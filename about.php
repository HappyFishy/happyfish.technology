            <p>30&#37; of website views are on a mobile device. That means nearly 1 in 3 of your consumers are looking at your website on a phone or tablet. With a responsive design, your content will be easy to see and interact with. This will take away the frustrating experience consumers have when they have to deal with a non-responsive design. No more pinching and zooming.</p>
